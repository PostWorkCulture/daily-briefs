## 18 August 2026: News depth, trusted Arsenal transfers, exact imagery, and lime Dida

Status: implemented

- Requested change: Add Calendar edge glow; keep at least 10 UK and 10 Local stories; add a trusted Arsenal transfer section; extend Arsenal's red hover to every box; remove generic AI and brief imagery; and make Dida lime, colourful, and icon-led.
- Approved scope: Calendar and Arsenal interaction styling, news collection and protected counts, Arsenal transfer sourcing and filtering, article-image provenance, Dida presentation, cache versions, responsive checks, master brief, and changelog.
- Files changed: scripts/refresh.py, scripts/enrich_arsenal.py, scripts/finalize_arsenal.py, scripts/refresh_story_images.py, scripts/responsive_ui_check.py, .github/workflows/morning-refresh.yml, js/app.js, js/tabs-dida.js, js/story-images-enhance.js, css/app.css, css/features.css, css/tabs-dida.css, css/aurora-nav.css, data/story-images.json, index.html, docs/MASTER-BRIEF-CURRENT.md, and docs/CHANGELOG.md.
- News rule: collect and de-duplicate broader local and national sources, with workflow failure if either profile has fewer than 10 Local News or 10 UK News items.
- Arsenal rule: show Transfer watch at the bottom; accept only approved first-team transfer updates from Arsenal.com, BBC Sport, Sky Sports, The Athletic, The Guardian, Reuters, or ESPN; reject rumour, gossip, paper-talk, betting, academy, and women's-team items.
- Image rule: remove every generic fallback and legacy generic mapping. Use only a high-resolution image selected by the exact matching publisher article page; otherwise keep the card text-only.
- Dida rule: lime-green treatment with playful, relevant code-native icons. No Dida photograph was added because Dida photos must come from Pete and remain exactly as supplied.
- Validation performed: pending full local, workflow, responsive Chrome, deployment, and live-data checks.
- Unexpected changes: none intended; existing profiles, shared Calendar content, weather, careers, TV Picks, and Around the World behaviour remain protected.
- Master brief update: version 1.5 records the protected hover, news-count, trusted-transfer, exact-image, and Dida rules.
- Follow-up: validate the first deployed refresh and tune only source breadth if either 10-item news threshold becomes fragile.

## 18 August 2026: England extremes, Chrome navigation, and image coverage

Status: validated

- Requested change: Restrict the warmest and coldest cards to England, always show town and county, repair the Chrome navigation, replace the low-quality Death Valley scenery image, and add more pictures to every article tab without exceeding one picture per article.
- Approved scope: Met Office extremes selection and validation, navigation layout and responsive regression checks, curated Around the World imagery, article-image sourcing and coverage, cache versions, master brief, and changelog.
- Files changed: scripts/enrich_weather_v2.py, scripts/responsive_ui_check.py, scripts/refresh_story_images.py, .github/workflows/morning-refresh.yml, css/tabs-dida.css, js/weather-extremes.js, js/scenery-facts.js, js/story-images-enhance.js, data/story-images.json, index.html, docs/MASTER-BRIEF-CURRENT.md, docs/CHANGELOG.md.
- Weather rule: aggregate only the eight Met Office England regional tables, then choose England's highest maximum and lowest minimum. Reject output unless both locations resolve to an English town and county.
- Navigation fix: restore the intended vertical six-item rail on desktop while preserving the single-row mobile navigation; add minimum button-size and orientation assertions.
- Image rule: replace uncontrolled Wikipedia summary images with curated 2,400px Wikimedia Commons images and reject any loaded source below 2,200 × 1,000 pixels.
- Article-image rule: target five unique images in every populated News, Arsenal, AI, and Career tab for both profiles, keep no more than one per article, require at least 1,200 × 675 pixels, and use relevant Wikimedia Commons fallbacks with API-verified dimensions when a story page has no verifiable high-resolution image.
- Validation performed: live Met Office parsing, synthetic country/county checks, JavaScript and Python syntax, local route checks, Chrome desktop/mobile layout checks, protected workflow validation, production refresh, deployment, and live-page verification.
- Unexpected changes: none intended; profiles, calendars, careers, news, Arsenal, AI, Dida, and TV Picks remain unchanged except for their normal morning data refresh.
- Master brief update: version 1.4 protects the England-only, town/county, high-resolution scenery, and per-tab article-image rules.
- Follow-up: none.

## 17 August 2026: Expanded UK and Sweden career search

Status: validated

- Requested change: Search harder across LinkedIn and other job sites, favour UK or Sweden roles for Sofia, and add more UK roles to Pete's Career section from the same sources.
- Approved scope: Career source collection, profile-specific filtering and ranking, Career validation, generated profile data, master brief, and changelog only.
- Files changed: scripts/refresh.py, data/pete.json, data/sofia.json, .github/workflows/morning-refresh.yml, docs/MASTER-BRIEF-CURRENT.md, docs/CHANGELOG.md.
- Requirements affected: Sofia's senior non-software product and work-pattern rules; Pete's UK Civil Service, public-sector, AI, digital, data, and automation focus; real links; morning reliability.
- Sources: LinkedIn public job listings, Arbeitnow, Remote OK, Remotive, Jobicy, and Sweden's official JobTech feed.
- Reliability: added shared fetching, UK/Sweden preference scoring, 30-day freshness checks, inactive-listing checks, de-duplication, and last-good Career fallback when all live sources fail temporarily.
- Validation performed: filter unit checks, live multi-source integration, full profile refresh, protected workflow assertions, JSON and JavaScript syntax checks, local route checks, and live deployment checks.
- Unexpected changes: none intended; calendar and all non-Career sections remain unchanged except for their normal live refresh.
- Master brief update: version 1.2 records the approved multi-site Career behaviour for both profiles.
- Follow-up: review the first deployed morning refresh and refine Pete's target role profile if he supplies narrower seniority, function, or salary criteria.

## 17 August 2026: Sofia career job matching

Status: validated

- Requested change: Focus Sofia's Career section on posted remote roles or roles with at least three work-from-home days.
- Approved scope: Sofia's Career refresh logic and its protected validation only.
- Files changed: scripts/refresh.py, data/sofia.json, .github/workflows/morning-refresh.yml, docs/MASTER-BRIEF-CURRENT.md, docs/CHANGELOG.md.
- Requirements affected: Sofia profile personalisation, current Career content, real job links, and morning validation.
- Matching profile: senior non-software product development; 17 years at Strategic Insight in B2B financial data.
- Work-pattern rule: fully remote, or explicit evidence of three or more WFH days; generic hybrid wording is rejected.
- Sources: current listings from the public Arbeitnow and Remote OK feeds, with no paid API dependency.
- Validation performed: filter unit checks, live source integration, full profile build, protected workflow assertions, JSON and JavaScript syntax checks, local route checks, and a live-link response check for the current match.
- Unexpected changes: none intended; Pete's Career feed and all unrelated sections remain unchanged.
- Master brief update: added the approved Sofia Career specification.
- Follow-up: validate the first deployed refresh and adjust title coverage only if genuine relevant roles are being missed.
